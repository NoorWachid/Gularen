## Why Not Use Markdown?
**Shorter**, create bold text with a single asterisk: `*bold*`.

**Consistency**, Every expression of Gularen only perform one action, and there is no alternative syntax.

**Better order and default**, In the image expression, the URL is the first argument `![https://i.imgflip.com/7r6vdk.jpg]`. You don't even have to write the label.

**Comment**, Anything after `~` in `now you see me ~ now you don't` will not be rendered.

**Secure**, You dont have to worry about inline HTML, because Gularen does not support inline HTML.

I drew most of my inspiration from AsciiDoc and Markdown, so there aren't any drastic changes to the syntax and structures.
