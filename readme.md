# Gularen
A well-thought lightweight markup language that makes sense

### Examples
``` gr
>>> C++: The Pain, The Pleasure, and The Migraine

>>--> Chapter 1: Data Types
>>-> Primitives

This section talks about integers.
This is still the same paragraph.

Now it's a different paragraph.

And the most important features. ^ Comments, seriously even HTML has one.

Font formatting is a little bit different from Markdown goes like this.
*Asterisks for bold*, _underlines for italic_, and `backticks for monospaced`.
*Combine them _all_ `together`* with grace.

And the lists:
1. Using numbers
2. So on
3. And so on
.. Or you tired counting you can use two dots
.. It automatically counted for you

- And hyphen for the bullet list
- You can easily create a nested list by adding 4 spaces to each level
    - I hate Python, but this is nice
    - You can have infinite levels of indentations

And of course the checklist or todo-list or whatever you name it.

[+] This one is checked
[-] This one is inbetween state (in progress or something)
[ ] This one is not
```

### Build
1. I'm pretty sure everybody knows how to use CMake.

### Author Notes
read the [tasks.gr](tasks.gr) for specification and the implementation progress.
