# Gularen
Well-thought lightweight markup language that actually make sense

### Examples
``` gr
>>> C++: The Pain, The Pleasure and The Migrane

>>-> Chapter 1: Data Types
>-> Primitive Data Types
-> Integers
This section talk about integers.
This is still the same paragraph.

Now its different paragraph.

And the most important features. ^ Comments, seriously even HTML has one.

Font formating is a little bit different from Markdown goes like this.
*Asterisks for bold*, _underlines for italic_ and `backticks for monospaced`.
*Combine them _all_ `together`* with grace.

And the lists:
1. Using numbers
2. So on
3. And so on
.. Or you tired counting you can use two dots
.. It automatically counted for you

- And hyphen for bullet list
- You can easyly create nested list by adding 4 spaces each levels
    - I hate Python but this is nice
    - You can have infinite levels of indentations (just kidding it depends on each `__SIZE_T__` implementation on your machine)

And of course the checklist or todo-list or what ever you name it

[+] This one is checked
[ ] This one is not

```
